==
kb is forked from cheat (https://github.com/chrisallenlane/cheat). It also draws inspiration and content from eg (https://github.com/srsudar/eg), tldr (https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr), and cheat.sh (https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sheets). It is a command line interface for a knowledge base consisting of text files and more. kb allows viewing of plain text resources, examples, and notes in a terminal and can launch a browser for viewing other file types.
